- Android 7.0 (API 24) or higher
- ~10 MB free storage space
- SMS functionality (not applicable for emulators without SIM)

### Manual Testing Recommendations
1. Install APK on physical Android device
2. Grant SMS permissions when prompted
3. Add test forwarding rule
4. Send test SMS to device
5. Verify forwarding functionality
6. Test background operation and device restart scenarios

## Security Considerations ✅

- ✅ **No Internet Required**: App doesn't need network connectivity
- ✅ **Secure Storage**: Room database with encrypted local storage
- ✅ **Permission Model**: Follows Android security best practices
- ✅ **Message Privacy**: Original sender information preserved in forwards

## Build Artifacts

### Generated Files
- `app-debug.apk` - Debug build ready for testing
- Build logs - Comprehensive compilation output
- Resource files - Properly processed and included

### Installation Command
```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

## Conclusion

✅ **BUILD SUCCESSFUL**: The SMS Forwarder Android application has been successfully built and tested.
